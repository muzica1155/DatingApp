when the messages were loading when we r not actually clicking on our messages tab but our message is,
is a clild component of our member detail page & when our member detailed page is constructed it also 
constracts the child inputs as well 7 bcozi our child input in the ngOnINt we 've got a call to load meaages thats
what going on in our member details component So we wna to control that we dnt want to load the message untill we know 
for sure what sm1 clicked on this particular tab 
let resolve 
take a look at member-details.component.html
tab heading= 'Messages'>
           <app-member-messages [username]="member.username"></app-member-messages>
           <!--just ot provide username property here & set this to member username -->
        </tab>

 this is the tab we r interested in & we need to know if this has been clicked on & we r using this tabset component

 <tabset class="member-tabset">

 Inside our member detail component & if we take a look at the member details component itelf 

 NOW TAKE A LOOK AT member-detail.component.ts 

 smthing that we used earlier on if we wanted to get hold of an element insdie our component code the template then we use template reference 
 variable  
 what  i m gonna do add a template reference variable to the tabset itself

 take a look at member-details.component.html


 <tabset class="member-tabset" #memberTabs>

///////
 Then member-details.component.ts


In our properties here bcoz it got decorator im just going to out it at the top & we can use View child to go & get the memberTabs

export class MemberDetailComponent implements OnInit {
@ViewChild()

activeTab: TabDirective;//so each 1 of our temps inside here we 've got a tp directive specifically for as well & what 

 take a look at member-details.component.html

 <tab heading= 'Interests'>

 </tab>

 Create a method inside our component & we'll just go down to the bottom here 7 we'll create a 
 Then member-details.component.ts

 if (this.activeTab.heading === 'Messages') // we r gonna access the heading property inside the tab for our messages 

 this is the heading <tab heading= 'Messages'>



 take a look at member-details.component.html


take a look at member-details.component.html

<!-- <app-member-messages [username]="member.username"></app-member-messages> -->

after chaing this into this 

<app-member-messages [messages]="messages"></app-member-messages>

now each o fthis tabs bcoz we've crated a method inside our member details component called on tap activated 

we ned to do insdie our member details component.html here

for each 1 of this tabs we need to say we'll give it a click event called select tab 

    <tab heading= 'About {{member.knownAs}}' (selectTab)="onTabActivated($event)"> evnt for this particular method 
    so our select tab will pass throughthe event & inside that event is the top directive  that wehave access to 

    copy the// (selectTab)="onTabActivated($event)"> // 

    & add to each of the heading tab elements
