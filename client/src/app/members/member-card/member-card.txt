these ng content applies to anything inside this class and what is effectively been defined

Used or i wanted to steal a card component that i had in a different then those styles
i just creted there would not apply and that's doen to angular css encupsulations 
member card component what we could do in our componnet here is specify the encupsulations
policy
encupsulations 1st options first ones is deprecated 
other options is the shadow dom instead the browsers no have an quivalent 
of what angular does here but it does it natively 
in the browsers and u need to specify that in the code i belive to use the shadoe dom for this 

we r using is view encupsulations Emulated & this is angular verision of using a shadows dom 
it basically gives our system encupsulations say ehat what we write inside our css files doesn't infect any
of the parts of our success or classes in our applications bcox css stands for 
cascading stasis is designed to be set a global level and cascades doen to all of 
the elements that share the same class doing
now behavior & angular is not to use that policy and not to cascades but to encupsulations the styles
inside a component 

so we use this encupsulations emulated by defaut i we didn't want the behaviour of the
that we would set this to view encupsulations of none & that would allow as to use global success and
withour any encupsulations here we wouldin order to target a class inside our component  if we wanted to
use global stylesheet to do that then we would need to set this encupsulations to none as we would not be able to target 
elements inside our component if we r using view encupsulations emulated there is a caveat to this day 
if it is not supply the value is taken from compiler options the default is emulated
if the policy is set to encupsulations emulated and a component has no styles or style u are specified 
then we automatically use ur encupsulations then but we do have a stylesheet here 
if we wnated to overwrite this then we would need to set our encupsulationsto none this is just a brif mentioning
of this component
not doing here stick to default & when we need to  style components  we will typically just use the component 
stylesheet to do so and that way each component is its own self-contained thing where we do not need to style
to worry about any style being being overridden at a global level
